# Sql

Querying data with Transact-SQL is a course from Edx.org that I took and passed (Data Analysis: Essential Skills Professinal Certificate/Data Science Core Professional Certificate) . These are my Lab test submissions with detailed explanation. Questions were also disclosed. All codes were tested and worked fine. I used MS Sql Server 2008R2 that is outdated and limited my possibilities.
